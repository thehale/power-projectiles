# Power Projectiles
This is a Minecraft Plugin for Bukkit/Paper/Spigot servers that adds several new
super-powered projectiles that make the standard potion tipped arrows look boring.

## Crafting and Use
As long as a player has gotten the Enchanter advancement, he/she can also see 
the recipe for all Power Projectiles. Each projectile's lore (the text below its
name) contains instructions for how to use it.
